As the snow melts and the season turns, here comesSufjan Stevensto remind us that everything dies. His new album,Carrie & Lowell, is centered around the death of his mother, Carrie, who was in and out of his life from the start. "There's such a discrepancy between my time and relationship with her, and my desire to know her and be with her," he recentlytoldPitchfork. "Should Have Known Better" takes us back to the beginning he remembers, where Carrie leaves him in a video store at the age of "three, maybe four." In a hushed voice, he sings like heâ€™s clinging onto a blanket for warmth as he fixates on the black shroud that enveloped him in the wake of her absence, muting his ability to transparently express himself.
